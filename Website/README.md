# Platform Engineering Toolkit (Static Site)

A tiny, clean-code starter you can host on GitHub Pages. Multi-page, image hotspots for navigation, accessible, and easy to PR.

## Quick start
1. Add your image as `toolkit.jpg` in the repo root.
2. If needed, update the two `<area>` `coords` in `index.html` to fit your symbols.
3. Commit and push to GitHub.
4. Enable **Settings → Pages → Source: `main` / root**.

## Contributing
- Add new topics by creating more `.html` pages and linking from `index.html`.
- Keep HTML semantic, CSS minimal, and JS small.
- Run accessibility checks (e.g., Lighthouse) when you change the image map or navigation.
